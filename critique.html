      Technology is constantly changing and improving. There is a law named Moore's law that roughly
      says technology will improve twice as much every two years. Teoman Soygul of QuanticDev 
      discusses the current state of software engineering beyond 2020. 
    </p>
    <p class="critique-p">He outlines 9 major areas in software:</p> 
    <ul class="games">
      <li>
        Growth of Programming
      </li>
      <li>
        Growth of Open-Source
      </li>
      <li>
        The Top Libraries
      </li>
      <li>
        Trending Projects
      </li>
      <li>

    <p class="critique-p">
        While there are great strides taken in the tech industry every year, some sectors don't
        actually change that much. For example, the top programming languages are Javascript,
        Python, Java, PHP, and C++. This doesn't really change (other than the order of popularity).
        For this reason, I will skip some sections that the author discusses.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="critique-p">
      The first thing that I think is really important is the Growth of Open-Source. The author 
      gives a couple of statistics reguarding the specifics, but to me the most important thing is
      that it is growing at all. Open Source really helps with Security, as vunerabilities can be 
      found very quickly since the code is readiliy available, and allows for customization.
    </p>

    <p class="critique-p">
      The next big topic is the Top Libraries. When you are writing code, often you encounter a 
      situation where you need to complete a task (an example is raising a number to a certain power). 
      Many small and easy tasks have already been written, so it doesn't make sense to write it 
      again. This is where packages come in. They are packages of code that have the functionality 
      already written. All you have to do is write 1 line of code, and you can leverage the power of
      many lines of code written by someone else. These days, many complex systems are dependant on
      lots of packages. I think that this is an issue, however it does not seem like the industry will be 
      straying away from this model. The biggest issue is that if one of your dependencies breaks down,
      your entire system has the potential to break down.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="critique-p">
      Another big topic the author writes about is Machine Learning. There is a lot of talk about A.I.,
      and understandably so. Machine Learning allows us to use computers to perform tasks that are not 
      necesarily case-based or predefined. One example is Amazon's Alexa. It would be impossible to 
      program Alexa to have a response to every possible sentence a user may say to her. However, we 
      can teach Alexa the alphabet and grammer rules, and train her to understand English. Machine 
      Learning also has other useful purposes like optimization or decision making with history.
      This will be a field that will definitely grow in the coming years, and I totally agree with 
      the author that Machine Learnine will be a sector to keep our eye on.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="critique-p">
      The final topic I want to talk about is Security. Recently, there have been a lot of data leaks
      and hacks against large corporations. This isn't a coincedence. As systems become more and more
      complex, compunded with the fact that lots of code is being moved online, attacks are getting 
      more and more frequent. This is very important for all software engineers to be aware of. Security
      often isn't taken into account as much as it should be when creating a program, as it adds complexity. 
      However, it seems that moving forwards it will have to change from an annoyance to a necessity.
    </p>  
    <br>
    <p class="critique-p">
      In conclusion, the landscape of software is shifting fast. If you are not a computer person, then
      most of this article probably doesn't apply to you. However, if you are a computer person, then this 
      article is a collection of the most important sectors in technology and fields to keep our eyes on.
